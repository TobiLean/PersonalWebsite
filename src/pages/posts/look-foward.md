So in the previous post I said something about writing everyday bla bla bla.... well it did not happen and I do not have any plans at the moment to make it happen so yes I overestimated my character.



## 1. Shaun

So I did not submit anything for the game competition :( but it's fine. I have decided to push everything GameMaker and Dodomush away, I just totally lost interest. I served it's purpose(I can't say what it was) and it served it well so for now Dodomush is on the bench.

## 2. Console.Readline("Watashiwa Tobi des")

I am excited to say I successfully completed my Japanese course with a certificate and I am now a basic speaker of the language Yayy Thank GOD.

Don't mess with me! 

## **And..**C#

I completed the book on C# (Pronounced CSharp) and I'm really happy I did because it takes me closer to some of my goals. 

## 3. Micronext

I might not have written the information on this post as well as I could have but I hope you understand and get inspired even though I didn't do my best at all to get to this stage. BTW get Microsoft To Do it helps a lot. Finally the Mindset book...okaeey thank you for reading!
