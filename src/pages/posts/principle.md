I originally did not want to write anything, but I had to anyways because I said I would post every day.

## 1. Tunda Game

I recently entered a game making competition and we were given about half a month to create a game from scratch using a theme they would give contestants. It's been days and only today did I manage to get anything done. On the first day I decided what kind of game I wanted to make and how I would make it. On the second day I attempted creating the player character, it was a very frustrating process but today after days of confusion I finally drew the sprite and I am satisfied with it. Now all I have left is the mechanics of the game, the environment and the enemies. 

## 2. What I've missed

I picked up a book not too long ago about mindsets and how to change them.

 I haven't been so consistent with it not because it's bad, I just have/had a bad habit of not going on with things or being committed. The book is really good so far and I would probably want to finish it before I recommend it to anyone. 

### And..

The other thing I have failed to complete is my language course. I applied for and started a Japanese language course because I felt the need to learn a second language and Japanese was a language I had been interested in. Although I haven't been doing it daily, I can successfully order a cup of coffee and tell someone I'd yes (Hai) :D

## 3. What am I going to do about it?

The plan is to focus 90% on the game competition and when I'm not doing that I could possibly just carry on with the book.
