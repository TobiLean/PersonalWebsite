This won't take long.\

If you haven't already read the purpose of this site at the bottom of the home page then you might want to.

I plan on writing posts everyday not like this one or this <!--StartFragment-->

[Tobi's Personal Website (segunlean.com)](https://t.segunlean.com/posts/before-i-push/)

<!--EndFragment--> But much more worded and hopefully engaging as they would usually be about what I'm doing, projects I have started/completed etc.

I hope to be able to at the end of the day inspire myself and the people that visit the site or read the daily logs and I hope that with God, this program and others I can further improve on myself and achieve the goals set before me.
