I would have already added the domain but my brother has the login details for the domain manager or whatever and his laptop is dead.

I have been working on this for 3 days. That's a lot of time gone for a website as basic as this. It's probably due to the fact I overlooked learning HTML and CSS when I was 13. I did, however, manage to get it running through help from my brother and some *genius googling*, so yeah here we are. The site is complete, except the stock images that are still in the portfolio section, I will replace those later with my pictures and possibly a video of a game I've been working on. This isn't really a blog post but yeah. Latersss
